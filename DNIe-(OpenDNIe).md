# DNIe (OpenDNIe)

Support for DNIe cards got merged by code from the OpenDNIe fork, by pull request #168. The code is now in Master. OpenSC does not support the Spanish Ceres cards.

## DNIe background

[DNIe](https://sede.sepe.gob.es/portalSede/en/firma-electronica/DNI-electronico) is one of the SpanishEid-s. Historically, there exists a patch for OpenSC which adds support for DNIe in OpenSC.
There were two different OpenSC implementations for Spanish National eID card (DNIe) support

* The official one provided by *Spanish irección General de la policía y de la Guardia Civil (DGP)* was based in OpenSC-0.11.8, released under GPLv3. It's not being currently maintained.
* *OpenDNIe* was an alternate LGPL implementation, written from scratch based on several documents and forums around DNIe.

From the public administration point of view the card has been procured by the Ministry of Interior (DGP's DNIe office), The chip card is a ST19WL34 provided by ST Microelectrónics and software has been procured by Fabrica Nacional De Moneda y Timbre (FNMT-RCM).

* The DNIe card software is closely related to FNMT's Ceres card, being very similar in structure and design.
* OpenDNIe is copyright 2011 of Juan Antonio Martinez ([GitHub](https://github.com/jonsito)).

Additionally there are some other data available:

* Certificates used to stablish Secure Messaging Channel (according CWA14890-1 standard),
  * EF 3F00/6020: ICC intermediate CA certificate in CVC (CardVerifiableCertificate) format,
  * EF 3F00/601F: ICC Certificate (CVC format).

* Extra information about card:
  * EF 3F00/0006: IDESP (Card Serial Number),
  * EF 3F00/2F03: DNIe card software version (not available in every cards),
  * Chip Serial Number can be obtained by mean of APDU 90 B8 00 00 07,
  * There is no EF(ATR) nor ED(DIR) files available,
  * PIN related data are stored at 3F00/0000, but no read/write operations available on this EF.

DataObjects shown in pkcs15 structure are only readable with special unpublished software at Police's office

Public and Private keys are stored together in the same EF (A proprietary file type 15 is returned from FCI) so public keys are not readable, and need to be extracted from certificates

The card stores Three certificates (PIN-CHV1 protected):

* User Certificate (Authentication),
* User Certificate (Signature),
* Intermediate CA Certificate.

These certificates are stored in compressed format.

The ATR's and masks used in OpenSC are:

* Running (user lifecycle) cards:
  * `3B:7F:00:00:00:00:6A:44:4E:49:65:00:00:00:00:00:00:03:90:00`,
  * `FF:FF:00:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:00:00:00:00:00:00:FF:FF:FF`.
* Invalidated (final phase) cards
  * `3B:7F:00:00:00:00:6A:44:4E:49:65:00:00:00:00:00:00:0F:65:81`,
  * FF:FF:00:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:00:00:00:00:00:00:FF:FF:FF.

## Supported algorithms

* DNIe supports PKCS1 padding and SHA1 hashes with 1024/2048bit RSA keys

## Known issues and incompatibilities

* Secure Messaging according CWA14890 standard is used to perform any critical task
* DNIe does not support Logical Channels as described in ISO7816-4. So every communication
with the card require the use of a single SM channel. This leads to many concurrency problems
* DNIe requires PIN (CHV1) to access UserCertificates
* As shown in pkcs15 tree, public and private keys are stored together in the same EF file, this
makes `pkcs15-tool --read-public-keys` to fail
* The chip is prone to self-destroy on voltage level changes. NEVER plug/unplug reader with DNIe inserted
* Some critical task needs to be done at Police's station with special hard/soft: Change/unlock pin, Certificate renewal
* DNIe does not support APDU chaining, instead envelope cmd is issued by mean of a proprietary APDU (CLA 90 + envelope cmd)

## OpenDNIe implementation

Current implementation of DNIe OpenSC driver consists in:

* `card-dnie.c` driver,
* `pkcs15-dnie.c` emulator layer,
* `cwa14890.c` card-independent implementation for CWA14890 standard for Secure Messaging,
* `cwa-dnie.c` DNIe Data provider for cwa14890.c, that provides (local) keys and certificates required to complain with cwa14890 SM protocol,
* a wrap function for sc_transmit_apdu() method, that catches al apdu requests, and translates into SM format when required,
* several glue patches.
