# MICARDO 2.1

The MICARDO 2.1 driver supports Estonian ID cards.

It works with Estonian ID cards and OpenSC is the official software used in Estonia for these cards (on Linux, Mac OS X and for PKCS#11 in Mozilla on Windows).
For more information see the EstonianEid page.

MICARDO driver also has code to support German BMI / D-trust cards, but the functioning of those cards has not been tested for a long time.

The card manual is available in the attachment (but not officially distributed otherwise).
