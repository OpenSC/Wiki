OpenSC provides a set of libraries and utilities to work with smart cards. Its main focus is on cards that support cryptographic operations, and facilitate their use in security applications such as authentication, mail encryption and digital signatures. OpenSC implements the standard APIs to smart cards, e.g. [PKCS#11 API](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/pkcs11/), [Windows' Smart Card Minidriver](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/smartcard/smart-card-minidriver-overview) and macOS CryptoTokenKit.

## Download

You can find the updated download links in the README or on the main github page.
Do NOT attempt to add them here or use any links from wiki to download software as wiki is open to anyone to edit and the links were spoofed previously. For more information, see [issue #2554](https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/issues/2554).
