# Windows Quick Start

1. Download the MSIs

    Download the latest release of OpenSC from README or from the main github page. For an 64 bit operating system download both, the 32 bit *and* the 64 bit installer.

    OpenSC offers the standard distribution as well as a light weight distribution. The light weight variant is compiled without external dependencies (such as OpenSSL or zlib) and has a limited set of card drivers and smart card tools.

2. Install the MSIs

    Run the installers as administrator. Program upgrades can be performed by using the installer without uninstalling the previous version.

    The *Typical* and *Complete* installation type install all available components. A *Custom Setup* allows disabling some of the following features:

    * *OpenSC PKCS#11 module*: PKCS#11 module usd by most open source and cross-platform software (like Firefox, Putty, TrueCrypt, OpenVPN etc)
    * *PKCS#11 Spy module*: Module of the PKCS#11 spy.
    * *OpenSC minidriver*: OpenSC minidriver for using smart cards with native Windows CSP applications (like Internet Explorer)
    * *Tools and profiles*: Tools for debugging and personalization. Includes profiles needed for running pkcs15-init.exe
    * *Start menu entries*: Start menu entries: link to documentation

    A 32 bit application running on 64 bit operating systems needs the 32 bit minidriver or 32 bit PKCS#11 module respectively. For this reason, on an 64 bit operating system install both, the 32 bit *and* 64 bit installer.

3. Test your installation

    Upon successful installation the 32 bit (and 64 bit) minidriver have successfully been registered with their registry keys in `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Cryptography\Calais\SmartCards` (the 32 bit keys on an 64 bit OS are available in `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Wow6432Node\Cryptography\Calais\SmartCards`).

    The PKCS#11 modules have been installed as `C:\Program Files\OpenSC Project\OpenSC\pkcs11\opensc-pkcs11.dll` and `C:\Program Files\OpenSC Project\OpenSC\pkcs11\onepin-opensc-pkcs11.dll` (the 32 bit libraries on an 64 bit OS are available as `C:\Program Files (x86)\OpenSC Project\OpenSC\pkcs11\opensc-pkcs11.dll` and `C:\Program Files (x86)\OpenSC Project\OpenSC\pkcs11\onepin-opensc-pkcs11.dll`)

    You may test minidriver support of your card with

    ```powershell
    C:\Windows\System32\certutil.exe -scinfo
    C:\Windows\SysWOW64\certutil.exe -scinfo
    ```

    You may test the PKCS#11 support of your card with

    ```powershell
    "C:\Program Files\OpenSC Project\OpenSC\tools\pkcs11-tool.exe" --login --test
    "C:\Program Files (x86)\OpenSC Project\OpenSC\tools\pkcs11-tool.exe" --login --test
    ```

4. Customize your configuration

    Change the default configuration file `C:\Program Files\OpenSC Project\OpenSC\opensc.conf` to your needs. The configuration options are explained within this file. For 32 bit applications on an 64 bit OS you need to also edit `C:\Program Files (x86)\OpenSC Project\OpenSC\tools\opensc.conf`.

5. Uninstall OpenSC

    Open the *Control Panel* and click on the *Uninstall a program* option under the *Programs* category. If you are using the Classic View of the *Control Panel*, then double-click on the *Programs and Features* icon instead. From the list of installed programs, choose *OpenSC smartcard framework* and click *Uninstall*. Do the same for *OpenSC smartcard framework (64bit)*.

    It is possible that a background process locks the minidriver library though uninstalling is successful. Remove `C:\Windows\System32\opensc-minidriver.dll` and `C:\Windows\SysWOW64\opensc-minidriver.dll` manually if required.
