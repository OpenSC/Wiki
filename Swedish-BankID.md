# Swedish BankID

BankID is an electronic certificate that's issued by several Swedish banks.

There has been a succession of three different proprietary protocols called "BankID":

* The first BankID used a Java applet, and could therefore work in multiple operating systems.
* The second BankID used a proprietary browser plug-in. FriBID is a free implementation of this protocol.
* The third BankID uses proprietary plug-ins or apps for Microsoft's, Apple's and Google's operating systems. No free implementation is available.

Soft tokens and smart cards are available. At least some smart cards have been reported to work with OpenSC and FriBID (browser plugin).
