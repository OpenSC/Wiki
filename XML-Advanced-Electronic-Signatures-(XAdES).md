# XML Advanced Electronic Signatures (XAdES)

More in [Application Support](Using-smart-cards-with-applications)

XML Advanced Electronic Signatures are defined in the ETSI standard [ETSI TS 101 903 V1.1.1](http://uri.etsi.org/01903/v1.1.1/).

OpenXAdES implements that standard in a library, and
[GNU DigiDoc](http://sourceforge.net/projects/gdigidoc) a graphical user interface application built on top the libdigidoc (AKA OpenXAdES).

libdigidoc uses PKCS#11 for smartcard access on non-windows platforms and works well with OpenSC.
