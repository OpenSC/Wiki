# [CVE-2024-1454](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-1454): Memory use after free in AuthentIC driver when updating token info

This advisory summarizes automatically reported security relevant issue
that was reported since the release of OpenSC 0.24.0 and that
are relevant to the handling the card enrollment process using pkcs15-init.

The Use After Free vulnerability was identified within the AuthentIC driver
during the card enrollment process using pkcs15-init when a user or administrator
enrolls or modifies cards. An attacker must have physical access to the computer
system to take advantage of this flaw. The attack requires a crafted USB device
or smart card to present the system with specially crafted responses to the APDUs,
which are considered high complexity and low severity. This manipulation can
potentially allow for compromising card management operations during enrollment.
