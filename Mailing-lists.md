**NB! You need to be subscribed before posting to any of the above lists!**

Please:

* Do not send carbon copies to the developers. We read all postings on the mailing list.
* Do not mail developers directly, we read all the mailing lists and the bugs address.
* Read about [Reporting Bugs](How-to-write-a-good-bug-report) before sending your e-mail.

Read why [privately asking developers](http://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/faqs/questions.html) is no good.

If you are subscribed to the mailing list, your posting will be distributed
immediately. If you are not subscribed, it will be put on hold, till someone has
reviewed it. This is an emergency procedure only, subscription is assumed.
