# SSH Secure Shell

## Windows (Putty)

[putty.exe](https://github.com/NoMoreFood/putty-cac/releases) from [Putty-CAC](http://www.risacher.org/putty-cac/), an improved version of [Putty-SC](http://www.joebar.ch/puttysc/) adds PKCS#11 support to putty, which the upstream version does not have. It works flawlessly with OpenSC PKCS#11 module. A fork of Putty, named [KiTTY](http://www.9bis.net/kitty/) also exists.
Using the [pageant.exe](https://github.com/NoMoreFood/putty-cac/releases) from Putty-CAC allows to use [WinSCP](http://winscp.net/eng/index.php) with smart cards as well.

## Linux / Mac OS X (OpenSSH)

See [OpenSSH and smart cards PKCS#11](OpenSSH-and-smart-cards-PKCS#11) for more information.

## PuttyCard (deprecated)

[PuTTYcard](PuTTYcard) is another, independent implementation to add smart card support to putty.
Read more about it [here](PuTTYcard).
