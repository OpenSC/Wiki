# HBCI homebanking

HBCI is a standard that is used by many banks in Germany.
Those banks offer either banking with PIN and TAN lists, or
using smart cards.

[KMyMoney](http://kmymoney2.sourceforge.net/) is a KDE application you can use for homebanking under linux.
It used [LibChipcard](http://www.libchipcard.de), a library for chip card access, and that library in turn
can use OpenSC.

You might need to use the latest snapshot packages. Feedback is very welcome.
