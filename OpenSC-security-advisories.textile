h1. OpenSC security advisories

Software often contains bugs, so does OpenSC. Be aware of the following security issues (in addition to overall [[security considerations|Security-Considerations]]) and upgrade to latest released version if needed.
 * 25.09.2023 Multiple issues have been identified in OpenSC, mostly buffer overflows, but also potential PIN
   bypass.
 ** The memory issues can be triggered by malicious smartcards sending malformed responses to APDU commands.
    Coded as ("CVE-2023-40661":http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-40661 and
    "CVE-2023-4535":http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2023-4535).
 ** The potential PIN bypass can happen when card tracks its own login state, demonstrated with Yubikey's PIV

 * 20.10.2021 Multiple issues have been identified in OpenSC, including heap double free, use after free/return, and buffer overflows. They can be triggered by malicious smartcards sending malformed responses to APDU commands. Coded as ("CVE-2021-42778":http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-42778, "CVE-2021-42779":http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-42779, "CVE-2021-42780":http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-42780 and "CVE-2021-42781":http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-42782)
 * 24.11.2020 Heap buffer overflows have been detected in the smart card drivers for oberthur, TCOS and Gemsafe GPK, which can be triggered by a specially crafted smart card during the initialization of OpenSC ("CVE-2020-26570":http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-26570, "CVE-2020-26571":http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-26571 and "CVE-2020-26572":http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-26572)
 * "13.09.2018":https://sourceforge.net/p/opensc/mailman/message/36414448/ Multiple issues have been identified in OpenSC, ranging from stack based buffer overflows to out of bounds reads and writes on the heap. They can be triggered by malicious smartcards sending malformed responses to APDU commands. Source: "X41-2018-002":https://www.x41-dsec.de/lab/advisories/x41-2018-002-OpenSC/.
